# 🎮 Adventure Stat Analyzer

This is a beginner-level C# console app that lets a user input character data and calculates various stats like average mission score, bonus item value, and hypotenuse for a magic gate. This project was created as part of my C# learning journey.

## 🧠 What It Does

- Takes character name and level as input
- Accepts scores from three missions and calculates the average
- Uses the `Math.Round()` function to round off the average score
- Generates a random bonus item value between 1 and 50
- Accepts base and height of a triangle and calculates the hypotenuse using `Math.Sqrt()`
- Uses string methods like `.ToUpper()`, `.ToLower()`, and `.Substring()` for output formatting
- Displays a summary in a fun, game-style format

## 💻 Technologies Used

- C# (.NET Console App)
- Random class for random number generation
- Math class (`Math.Round()`, `Math.Sqrt()`)
- String manipulation methods

## 📷 Sample Output

Enter character name: Keabetswe
Enter level: 10

Enter score from mission 1: 80
Enter score from mission 2: 75
Enter score from mission 3: 90

Your average score is: 82
Your bonus item value is: 37

Enter base of the triangle: 3
Enter height of the triangle: 4
The magic gate length is: 5

SUMMARY:
Welcome, KEABETSW!
Level: 10
Top mission start: kea
You're a real warrior!

## 🚀 Future Ideas

- Add retry functionality without restarting the app
- Store character stats in a file
- Include more missions or stat-based challenges
- Add a "level up" reward system based on average score
